    "# Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is the overall distribution of customer ages in the dataset?**\n",
    "   - **Result**: The dataset reveals that the average age of customers is 44.06 years. The most significant age group is \"Old\" (60+ years), consisting of approximately 90,000 customers. \"Middle-Aged Adults\" (40-59 years) make up about 60,000 individuals, while \"Young Adults\" (20-39 years) account for 20,000 customers. The smallest group consists of teenagers (under 20), with a minor representation. Age distribution appears relatively consistent from 20 to 70 years, with age 60 being notably more frequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How does the average purchase amount vary across different product categories?**\n",
    "   - **Result**: The average purchase amount varies slightly across categories. Footwear has the highest average purchase at 60.26 dollars, followed by Clothing at 60.03 dollars, and Accessories at 59.84 dollars. Outerwear has the lowest average at 57.17 dollars. Despite slight variations, the overall differences across categories are marginal, suggesting similar spending behavior among customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Which gender has the highest number of purchases?**\n",
    "   - **Result**: Males have a higher total number of purchases than females. However, male customers tend to spend slightly more on average, at 60.25 dollars, compared to 59.54 dollars for female customers. This suggests that while males make more purchases, female customers’ spending is very close on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What are the most commonly purchased items in each category?**\n",
    "   - **Result**: The top items by category include:\n",
    "     - **Accessories**: Jewelry, Sunglasses, and Belts.\n",
    "     - **Clothing**: Pants and Blouses.\n",
    "     - **Footwear**: Sandals and Shoes.\n",
    "     - **Outerwear**: Jackets and Coats.\n",
    "   - These items consistently reflect the top choices in their respective categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Are there any specific seasons or months where customer spending is significantly higher?**\n",
    "   - **Result**: While Spring shows a slight edge in purchase frequency, the differences across seasons (Spring, Fall, Winter, and Summer) are minimal, suggesting that customer spending is relatively stable throughout the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What is the average rating given by customers for each product category?**\n",
    "   - **Result**: Footwear receives the highest average rating (3.79), followed by Accessories (3.77), Outerwear (3.75), and Clothing (3.72). This indicates that Footwear generally receives more favorable customer reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Are there any notable differences in purchase behavior between subscribed and non-subscribed customers?**\n",
    "   - **Result**: Non-subscribed customers tend to spend slightly more on average, with 59.87 dollars compared to 59.49 dollars for subscribed customers. However, the overall spending differences between the two groups are minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Which payment method is the most popular among customers?**\n",
    "   - **Result**: Debit Cards are the most popular payment method, with an average spend of 60.92 dollars, followed closely by Credit Cards at 60.07 dollars and Bank Transfer at 59.71 dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Do customers who use promo codes tend to spend more than those who don't?**\n",
    "   - **Result**: Customers not using promo codes spent a higher total amount (133.6K dollars) than promo code users (99.4K dollars). However, promo code users often make larger individual purchases due to perceived discounts, suggesting the effectiveness of promo codes in increasing purchase frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **How does the frequency of purchases vary across different age groups?**\n",
    "    - **Result**: There is a balanced distribution across all purchase frequencies (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc.) across age groups, suggesting that customers of all ages engage similarly in purchasing behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Are there any correlations between the size of the product and the purchase amount?**\n",
    "    - **Result**: Medium-sized products (M) generate the highest total sales, followed by Large (L), Small (S), and Extra-Large (XL) sizes. This suggests medium sizes are the most popular and should be prioritized in inventory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Which shipping type is preferred by customers for different product categories?**\n",
    "    - **Result**: Shipping preferences vary across categories. Free Shipping is most popular for Footwear and Outerwear, while Standard Shipping is favored for Clothing. Store Pickup is most preferred for Accessories.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **How does the presence of a discount affect the purchase decision of customers?**\n",
    "    - **Result**: Non-discounted items account for a higher total spend (133.6K dollars) compared to discounted items (99.4K dollars). Female customers tend to favor non-discounted products, while male customers show more balance in purchasing both discounted and non-discounted items.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Are there any specific colors that are more popular among customers?**\n",
    "    - **Result**: Olive, Yellow, and Silver are the most popular colors, followed by Teal and Green. These trends reflect customer preferences for earth and metallic tones.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **What is the average number of previous purchases made by customers?**\n",

    "# Business recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Age-Based Segmentation Strategy**: The dataset indicates a higher concentration of customers in the \"Old\" (60+) and \"Middle-Aged Adults\" (40-59) groups. Marketing efforts should focus on these segments, which demonstrate higher purchasing activity. Meanwhile, strategies should be devised to increase engagement with the underrepresented younger demographics (20-39 and teenagers) through tailored product offerings and promotional campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pricing Optimization by Category**: Footwear and Clothing show higher average transaction values, suggesting a greater propensity for spend in these categories. A dynamic pricing strategy, possibly incorporating bundling or tiered pricing, could optimize revenue. Outerwear, which exhibits lower average spend, may benefit from revised pricing strategies or targeted promotions to improve its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Gender-Based Consumer Behavior Insights**: Males, while purchasing more frequently, demonstrate a slightly higher average spend. This insight should inform targeted promotions for male customers, potentially focusing on high-value products or premium offerings. Conversely, female customers, who show near-equal spending patterns, could benefit from personalized marketing approaches to enhance engagement and conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Seasonality-Driven Campaigns**: While seasonal fluctuations in purchase behavior are minimal, a slight increase in transactions during Spring presents an opportunity for seasonal promotions. Strategically timed offers or limited-time discounts during this period could capitalize on this subtle increase in consumer activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Product Experience & Customer Satisfaction**: Footwear consistently receives higher ratings, indicating a favorable customer experience. This can be leveraged to enhance brand reputation in this category. To elevate customer satisfaction across other categories, focus on maintaining high product quality, optimizing the user experience, and addressing potential pain points in customer feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Subscription and Promo Code Strategy**: Non-subscribed customers exhibit slightly higher average spend, suggesting potential for increasing subscription conversion rates. Offering tailored subscription benefits, such as early access to sales or personalized recommendations, could increase lifetime value. For promo code users, further analysis of the effectiveness of discounts could identify opportunities to refine promotional tactics without compromising profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Shipping Preference Adjustments**: The preference for Free Shipping in categories like Footwear and Outerwear suggests that extending this offering to other product categories, such as Clothing, could improve conversion rates and overall satisfaction. Analyzing shipping costs and margins could further optimize shipping strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Inventory Allocation by Product Size**: Medium-sized products are the top performers in terms of revenue, indicating demand trends for this product size. Inventory should prioritize these sizes, particularly in Footwear and Clothing categories, to ensure adequate stock levels. Smaller and larger sizes should be optimized according to observed demand patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Discount Effectiveness**: Non-discounted items represent a higher total spend, suggesting that full-price purchases maintain a strong revenue contribution. The discount strategy should focus on enhancing customer retention and driving volume without undercutting full-price sales. Consider targeted discounting strategies to avoid cannibalizing regular price revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Geographic Market Targeting**: Customers from regions such as Alaska, Pennsylvania, and Arizona show higher average spends. These geographic areas should be considered for localized marketing efforts or region-specific offers. Understanding regional preferences can refine product offerings and pricing strategies to maximize revenue from high-spending areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **High-Value Customer Segmentation**: Cluster 3 customers, who exhibit the highest average spend, represent a key opportunity for high-touch marketing and VIP programs. Tailored loyalty programs or exclusive offers can increase retention within this segment and maximize customer lifetime value.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Customer Retention and Loyalty Initiatives**: The data shows that repeat customers have a significant impact on overall spend. A targeted loyalty program that rewards frequent buyers can enhance customer retention, increase the average transaction value, and drive long-term revenue growth."
